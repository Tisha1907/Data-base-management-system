Q1: Table Creation
Student Table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentId     NUMBER(4) PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName   VARCHAR2(40),
    Address1      VARCHAR2(300) NOT NULL,
    Gender        VARCHAR2(15),
    Course        VARCHAR2(8)
);

Course Table
CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID   NUMBER(2),
    DeptNo     NUMBER(2) PRIMARY KEY,
    Dname      VARCHAR2(20),
    Location   VARCHAR2(10)
);

Q2: Insert Records
Insert into Student
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (7369, 'Suresh', 'Delhi', 'Male', 'MCA');
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (7777, 'Ramesh', 'Mumbai', 'Male', 'BCA');
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2233, 'Sunita', 'Chennai', 'Female', 'MBA');
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (8899, 'Sneha', 'Pune', 'Female', NULL);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (9900, 'Sanjay', 'Kolkata', 'Male', 'MCA');

Insert into Course
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (1, 10, 'MCA', 'Delhi');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (2, 20, 'BCA', 'Mumbai');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (3, 30, 'MBA', 'Pune');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (4, 40, 'B.Tech', 'Chennai');
INSERT INTO Course VALUES (5, 50, 'M.Tech', 'Bangalore');

Q3: Queries
2. List all information about all students
SELECT * FROM Student;


Shows all rows & columns of Student.

3. List all student IDs along with their respective courses
SELECT StudentId, Course FROM Student;


Returns student id + course only.

4. List course names and their corresponding locations
SELECT Dname, Location FROM Course;

5. List the details of students enrolled in the MCA course
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Course = 'MCA';

6. List the names of students whose IDs are 7369, 7777, and 2233
SELECT StudentName FROM Student
WHERE StudentId IN (7369, 7777, 2233);

7. List the names of students not belonging to department 10 or 40

(Need JOIN with Course to check DeptNo)

SELECT s.StudentName
FROM Student s
JOIN Course c ON s.Course = c.Dname
WHERE c.DeptNo NOT IN (10, 40);

8. List the names of students who are not assigned any course
SELECT StudentName FROM Student
WHERE Course IS NULL;

8 (second part). Names starting with uppercase “S”
SELECT StudentName FROM Student
WHERE StudentName LIKE 'S%';

9. Names ending with “s”
SELECT StudentName FROM Student
WHERE StudentName LIKE '%s';

10. Examples of Arithmetic Functions
SELECT 10+5 AS Addition,
       10-5 AS Subtraction,
       10*5 AS Multiplication,
       10/5 AS Division,
       MOD(10,3) AS Modulus
FROM dual;


dual is a dummy table in Oracle.

11. Student names, course fees, and 10% scholarship

(Assume fees: MCA=40000, BCA=30000, MBA=50000, B.Tech=60000, M.Tech=70000)

SELECT s.StudentName, 
       CASE s.Course
            WHEN 'MCA' THEN 40000
            WHEN 'BCA' THEN 30000
            WHEN 'MBA' THEN 50000
            WHEN 'B.Tech' THEN 60000
            WHEN 'M.Tech' THEN 70000
       END AS CourseFee,
       (CASE s.Course
            WHEN 'MCA' THEN 40000
            WHEN 'BCA' THEN 30000
            WHEN 'MBA' THEN 50000
            WHEN 'B.Tech' THEN 60000
            WHEN 'M.Tech' THEN 70000
       END)*0.10 AS Scholarship
FROM Student s;

12. Student names having “k” as second character
SELECT StudentName FROM Student
WHERE StudentName LIKE '_k%';


 _ means single character, so "k" is second character.

13. Students not assigned to any department

(Student’s course not in Course table)

SELECT s.StudentName
FROM Student s
LEFT JOIN Course c ON s.Course = c.Dname
WHERE c.DeptNo IS NULL;

14. Student details in ascending order by course
SELECT * FROM Student
ORDER BY Course ASC;

15. Count the number of students enrolled in the BCA course
SELECT COUNT(*) AS BCA_Students
FROM Student
WHERE Course = 'BCA';
Q16. Count the total number of students in the Student table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Students
FROM Student;


 COUNT(*) counts all rows in the Student table.

Q17. Create a table with a primary key constraint
CREATE TABLE Department (
    DeptId   NUMBER(3) PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR2(50)
);


 DeptId is Primary Key → ensures uniqueness + NOT NULL.

Q18. Create a table with all columns having NOT NULL constraints
CREATE TABLE Faculty (
    FacultyId   NUMBER(3) NOT NULL,
    FacultyName VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    Subject     VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL
);


 Every column must have a value (no NULL allowed).

 Q19. Create a foreign key constraint referencing the Course table
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    EnrollId   NUMBER(3) PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentId  NUMBER(4),
    CourseId   NUMBER(2),
    CONSTRAINT fk_course FOREIGN KEY (CourseId) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
);


 CourseId in Enrollment references CourseID in Course.

 Q20. Create a table with a UNIQUE key constraint on a column
CREATE TABLE Library (
    BookId     NUMBER(4) PRIMARY KEY,
    ISBN       VARCHAR2(20) UNIQUE,
    Title      VARCHAR2(100)
);


 ISBN must be unique, but can accept NULL (unlike primary key).

Q21. Display different students from departments 1 and 2

(Join Student–Course tables, filter by DeptNo)

SELECT DISTINCT s.StudentName, c.DeptNo
FROM Student s
JOIN Course c ON s.Course = c.Dname
WHERE c.DeptNo IN (1, 2);


 DISTINCT ensures unique student names.

Q22. Display the list of students ordered by course
SELECT StudentName, Course
FROM Student
ORDER BY Course;


 ORDER BY sorts results alphabetically by course.

 Q23. Display an alphabetically sorted list of student names
SELECT StudentName
FROM Student
ORDER BY StudentName ASC;
